# R_and_Statistics

## Project Overview
For this project I analyzed two datasets, MechaCar_mpg.csv and Suspension_Coil.csv to determine if the car prototype manufacturing is consistent across lots. Using the R programming language. This analysis is necessary to determine what last minute changes need to be made for successful car producition. 
The car prototype, MechaCar is suffering from production troubles due to certain vehicle specifications and manufacturing processes.
